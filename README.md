This repository contains an interactive Microsoft Excel dashboard designed to analyze and visualize the Electric Vehicle (EV) population distribution and adoption trends. This project was developed between January 2025 and April 2025 to provide a dynamic tool for understanding EV growth patterns.

✨ Key Features
Interactive Data Visualization: Implemented dynamic pivot tables, slicers, and interactive charts to enable real-time filtering and granular analysis of EV data.

Performance Indicators: Utilized calculated fields and custom formulas (Advanced MS Excel) to derive key insights and create meaningful Performance Indicators (KPIs) related to EV growth and adoption rates.

Enhanced Usability: Improved dashboard navigation and user experience by integrating hyperlinks, descriptive icons, and a structured visual layout, ensuring a clean and efficient analytical workflow.

💻 Technologies Used
MS Excel (Advanced): Used for data processing, pivot table creation, formula implementation, charting, and dashboard design.

📈 Dashboard Overview
The dashboard serves as a comprehensive tool for stakeholders to quickly assess:

Geographic Distribution: Where EV adoption is highest.

Trend Analysis: How the EV population has grown over time.

Key Metrics: Insights derived from custom calculations (e.g., year-over-year growth, market penetration rates).
